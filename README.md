## Motivation

> Finishing the last 20% of a project takes 80% of the time.
>
> (Source: Someone on the internet)

The goal of SnapTemplate is to already have the last 20% ready, before you even start the project. The same applies to the first 20% of a project: infrastructure, boilerplate and project setup. 

Even if you don't plan to finish the last 60% of it, it allows to test a quick idea with a full app experience around it.


# SnapTemplateDemo

An Xcode project with a base setup of [SNAP](https://github.com/simonnickel/snap). The app comes with structure, navigation and infrastructure prepared, to quickly setup a new app using the SNAP packages.


## Create new App

1. Create and clone repository.
2. Copy files from snap-app-template and get everything in the correct place.
3. Rename project.
    1. Rename top item in project navigator.
    2. Change bundle identifier.
4. Follow setup steps of [snap-settings-service](https://github.com/simonnickel/snap-settings-service#setup).


## Template

The Template comes with:
 
1. Infrastructure to define dependencies and configuration of SNAP packages ready to go.
2. Boilerplate to define a navigation hierarchy for the app using [snap-navigation](https://github.com/simonnickel/snap-navigation).
3. A base settings screen using [snap-settings-service](https://github.com/simonnickel/snap-settings-service) with some theme configuration options.
